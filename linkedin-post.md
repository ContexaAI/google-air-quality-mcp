🚀 Excited to announce the release of my open-source Google Air Quality MCP Server! 🌍

I've built a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that brings real-time air quality data to AI assistants like Claude, making environmental data more accessible than ever.

🔧 What it does:
✅ Real-time air quality conditions for any location worldwide
✅ Hourly forecasts and historical data
✅ Interactive heatmap visualizations
✅ Natural language location queries
✅ Lightweight Docker deployment (~54MB)

💡 Why this matters:
With climate change and air pollution becoming increasingly critical issues, having instant access to air quality data through AI assistants can help people make informed decisions about their health and daily activities.

🛠️ Built with:
• Go 1.21+
• Google Air Quality API
• Model Context Protocol (MCP)
• Docker for easy deployment

🎯 Perfect for:
• Developers building AI-powered environmental apps
• Researchers analyzing air quality trends
• Anyone wanting to integrate air quality data into their AI workflows

The server is production-ready with comprehensive documentation, Docker support, and easy integration with MCP-compatible AI assistants.
